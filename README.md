Hello!

This is a project for the HTML Section of The Odin Project's Foundataions Course. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my HTML foundational skills. This will cover the correct usage of HTML elements and tags, working with text, lists, links, and images. The correct way of Git commit messages will be practiced for this project.

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website will not look very pretty since I have not yet tackled the CSS concepts, but I will come back and improve this project from time to time as I aquire new skills.

The long term dream for this project is to be a full-stack website wherein users can log in and share recipes to other users, while other users can view and rate recipes posted by other users.

The short term dream is to apply what I learned from the TOP courses.

Updates:
v0.1.0 - Finish layouting of landing page

Planned features for October:
Change html and css structure to flexbox
Add Changelog page to keep track of updates
Add template for recipe page
Add logo, fix nav bar, Featured Recipes alignment, header and footer paddings(?)
